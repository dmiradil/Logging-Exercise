For running this code you do not need to install or import any libraries. 
This is pure vanilla Python3 code which sorts and prints output of the logs by browsers and browser versions.

First I tried to loop over the logs by comparing the csv files which are located inside the user-agent folder by using csv Python libarary, but I understood that if I go that way it will be taking longer, and I will need to run 4 times to go through each csv files.
